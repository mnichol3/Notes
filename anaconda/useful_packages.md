# Useful Python Packages Available Through Anaconda
Here are some useful Python packages available through the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/) that I frequently install into new [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environments


## Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an extremely versitile 2D plotting library.

### Quick Installation
Matplotlib is available through the Anaconda Cloud [`conda-forge` channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
```
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```


## NumPy
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is "*the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python*" and part of the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem. It includes functions for simple, as well as complex, mathematical operations on scalars, vectors, and matrices.

### Quick Installation
NumPy is available through the Anaconda Cloud [`conda-forge` channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numpy)
```
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
```
  
  
## SciPy
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is *a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering* that includes [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy Library](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [IPython](http://ipython.org/), [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as core packages.

### Quick Installation
SciPy is available through the Anaconda Cloud [`conda-forge` channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scipy)
```
conda install -c conda-forge scipy
```
