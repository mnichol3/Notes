# Useful Python Packages Available Through Anaconda
Here are some useful Python packages available through the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/) that I frequently install into new [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environments

## NumPy
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is "*the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python*" and part of the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem. It includes functions for simple, as well as complex, mathematical operations on scalars, vectors, and matrices.

### Quick Installation
NumPy is available through the [`conda-forge` channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numpy)
```
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
```
  
## SciPy
