# Black Carbon

### Overview
Black carbon (BC) is a potent particulate matter polutant that results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, wood, and other fuels.[1] Complete combustion would result in the production of solely carbon dioxide, however combustion is never complete. As a result, organic compounds including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, organic carbon, and black carbon are produced.[1]  

Black carbon is a short-lived pollutant with a short lifetime of only days to weeks after being released into the atmosphere.[1] Though short-lived, BC can have significant impacts on the climate and human health.[1]

### Primary Sources
Many developed countries have managed to decrease their BC emissions over the past decades due to the implementation of stricter air quality regulations.[1] However, many developing countries have seen an increasing trend in BC emissions over the same time period, as air quality is not well regulated, if at all.[1] 

Open biomass burning and residential solid fuel combustion in Asia, Africa, and Latin America contribute approximately 88% of global BC emissions.[1]

### Impacts - Climate
Black carbon is very effective at absorbing light and heating its surrounings, making it an important contributor to global warming.[1] Per unit of mass, BC has a warming impact on the climate that is 460-1,500 times stronger than that of carbon dioxide.[1]

### Impacts - Human Health
Black carbon and its co-pollutants are key components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, the leading cause of poor health and premature deaths contributable to the environment.[1] 

The particles, measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are able to penetrate into the deepest regions of the lungs and transport toxic compounts directly into the bloodstream.[1] 

PM2.5 has been directly linked to a number of health hazards including lung disease, heart attacks, chronic respiratory diseases, and acute lower respiratory infections.[1] An estimated 7 million deaths are attributed to household and outdoor exposure to PM2.5 pollution annually.[1]

### Solutions
* **Household Energy**[1]

  * Eliminate high-emitting diesel vehicles
* **Agriculture**[1]
  * Ban open-field burning of agricultural waste
* **Fossil Fuels**[1]
  * Capture and improve oil flaring and gas production
* **Waste Management**[1]
  * Ban open burning of municipal waste



# Methane

### Overview
Methan is a powerful greenhouse gas emitted by human activities such as leakage from natural gas systems and the raising of livestock.[2]
